# My MacOS Setup

- Window Management: Window management is a pain on MacOS so I heavily customize it.
  - [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com): Snap and resize windows in macOS using keyboard.
    - My config has Super-Alt-Left snap window to left, Super-Alt-Right snaps window to right, Super-Alt-Up maximize and down minimize.
  - [Alt-Tab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app): Provides Windows/Linux like Alt-Tab functionality to switch without grouping application windows together.
    - Appartion Delay: 40ms, Max width and height on screen: 80%, Hide window thumbnails: true
- Network
  - [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html): Firewall and network monitoring
- Virtualization
  - [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app): Much better Parallels open source alternative. I've had Parallels unable to reach their license server and having me stuck during critical development time.
  - [Multipass](https://multipass.run): For running microVMs. I prefer this over docker.
  - [Rancher Desktop](https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/): In case docker is really needed.
